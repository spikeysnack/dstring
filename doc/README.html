<h2>INTRO</h2>

<h3>
  Hello and welcome.
  dstrings are dynamic (runtime-allocated) strings <br>
  that carry their used and free size with them.<br>
<p> 

<p>
  In memory they look like this:<br>
</h3>
<font size="4" color="blue">
</font><pre><font size="4" color="blue">
  [ --------------- struct dst -----------------]
  | len | free | str          |0|               |
  |-----| -----| -------------------------------| 
                 ^<u>  cstring   </u>^0^<u>    space _  </u> ^ </font><figure 1=""><font size="4" color="blue">
</font>
</figure></pre>

<p>
<h3>  In C code they look like this:<br> </h3>

<font size="4">
<pre class="prettyprint">
struct dst 
{
   size_t len; 
   size_t free; 
   char[] str; 
};
</pre>
</font>

<h3>
  They are addressed by the <b><i>char*</i></b> member of their struct ('str' above)<br>
  so that they behave exactly like regular c-style char strings.  <br>
  The structure size is insignificant in memory usage compared <br>
  to the potential size of the string data, <br>
  but having the size and free data  greatly speeds up operations <br>
  on the strings such as appending, truncating, resizing, and editing.<br> 
<p>  
  When operating on a dstring as a memory object you need to <br>
  address its struct address and its size_t members, <br>
  but otherwise you use it just like another C-style string. <br>
  C sees a pointer to a character array (char*) <br>
  and libc functions know exactly what to do with it,<br> 
  ignoring the size_t variables before the (char[]). <br> 
  However, an extra element of safety is introduced <br>
  by always knowing exactly the size and free memory available<br> 
  in the dstring, and never exceeding it, <br>
  or reallocating enough additional memory before a buffer overrun occurs.<br>

	and <i>/usr/local/include</i> <br> 
	and requires admin or sudo privileges.<br>
	Alternatively you may put <i>libdstring.so.1</i> and its<br>
	link <i>libdstring.so</i> and the associated headers<br>
	<i>dstring.h, localdstring.h, dstring_llist.h, dstringlist.h</i> and <i>dstringarray.h</i><br>
	in devel locations of your choosing. <br>

	dstring_llist.h ,dstringlist.h, and dstringarray.h<br>  
	are optional, but useful.<br>

	Use a standard 'make' or 'make all' or "make install" command.<br>

<h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<h3>   
  As in <i>figure 1</i> above, the layout is simple, yet some explanation is <br>
  necessary to avoid common mistakes in programs.<br>
<p>
  The psuedo-type dstring is simply an alias for (char*).<br>
<p>
  It is accepted as a c-style string by all standard C string functions.<br>
</p><p>
<font size="2"><i>To avoid confusions in the dstring library the alias cstring is used for (char*) <br>
  to indicate a regular pointer to an  array of chars and not a dstring.</i></font>
<p>
  Wrapping the character data is the following structure:<br>
</p></h3>
<font size="3">
<pre class="prettyprint"> 
struct dst 
 {
  size_t len; // number of chars used 
  size_t free; // number of chars not used but available 
  char str[]; // actual c-style string 
 };
</pre>
</font>

<font size="2" color="brown">  
  For consistency, speed, and accuracy, it is mandatory that<br>
<p>
      1. all memory allocations occur at multiples of 16 bytes.<br>
         Strings can be of any length, always terminated with <font color="green">'\0'</font> .<br>
	 <i>(d-&gt;len + d-&gt;free)</i> will always be a multiple of 16.<br>
<p> 
      2. all memory operations on dstrings (and thus on dst structures)<br>
         occur only on the whole dst struct and never on the str part<br>
         only.<br>
<p>
      3. changing a dstring requires a recalculation of its size variables.<br>

</font>

<hr>

<h2>NORMAL USAGE</h2>

<h3>Simple, normal object-style C programming:</h3> 
<p> 

<font size="3">
<pre class="prettyprint" >

       dstring ds = new_dstring_init( "a 16 char string" , 32 );  /* 16 bytes used, 32 bytes available */
       printf( "Use just like a char*: %s \n", ds );
       printf( "dstring is %zu chars long with %zu free chars of space left. \n", 
               dstlen(ds), dstfree(ds) );
       DSFREE(ds); // A macro that nulls the pointer as well as frees the memory

</pre>
</font>

<h2>ADVANCED USAGE</h2>

<h3>	 
   To get at the characters in a dstring, just access them like<br>
   regular c-strings. 
<p>
 <pre class="prettyprint" >
   mydstring[4]  // returns the 5th char of mydstring.
</pre>

<br>
   The emptydstring() function returns  a dst structure with<br>
   len = 0 , free=16, and str = "" (not NULL); Thus it passes<br>
   consistency checks and is ready for a string to be appended.<br>
          <br>
   The utilities dstlen, dstfree, is_dstring are for general use<br>
   dstlen should be faster than strlen. <br>
   dst_mem returns the total size of the dst struct to help against<br>
   comitting buffer overflows.<br>
<br>
   <b>sharing dstrings</b> -- the dstring type is a pointer type,<br>
   so any dstring can be assigned to another dstring variable.<br>
   Make sure to dettach pointers after all their accesses are done <br>
   except for one used to free the memory -- <br>
   this is just normal good practice in C. <br>
   dstrings have memory garbage in them before initializaton <br>
   so be sure to assign them to NULL at declaration , <br>
   and instantiate them before use. <br>
<p>
 <h2> <b>localdstrings</b> </h2>
<p>
<h3>
   Local dstrings -- stack-allocated local dstrings are provided<br>
   for short-term use inside functions. 80% of strings in a <br>
   program are temporary and used read-only. localdstrings are<br>
   automatically recycled at the return of the function when it<br>
   exits. They must not be used as return values or as parameters<br>
   to functions, or garbage and segmentation faults will result.<br>
   Inside the function that they are instantiated in they retain<br>
   integrity and may be used just as normal  locally statically-allocated<br>
   c-style strings. They use the alloca functions provided by<br>
   gcc and clang and others. tcc and pcc may not be able to <br>
   take advantage of local dstrings.<br>
<br>
   If many concatenations are to be made (building long strings) <br>  
   use a large buffer on creation to speed up processing and to reduce<br>
   the number of internal realloc calls. When the concatenations are<br>
   finished (or whenever optimally convienent), call dstring_minimize_mem <br>
   to release the free memory in the dstring.<br>
   (See the note in <i>dstring.c</i> at the <i>dstring_append function.</i>)   <br>
</p></h3>

<font size="3" color="blue">
<pre class="prettyprint">
 dstring buildastring = NULL; 
 buildastring = new_dstring_init("", 32768); // 32K to start 
 buildastring = dstring_append(buildastring, "append this" ); 
 ... (large number of appends ...)
 
 dstring_minimize_mem( buildastring); // free unused mem
</pre>

<pre>   Use the macros DSFREE and (DSLISTFREE for lists) to assure that
   dangling pointers are avoided.

</pre>
</font>


<h2>DSTRINGLISTS</h2>
<h3>   
   dstringlists are an implementation of double-linked lists<br>
   taken directly from the linux kernel implementation.<br>
   A little study of the code in dstring_llist.h and dstringlist.h<br>
   and the included test programs should suffice to utilize<br>
   these powerful list facilites, although arrays are better for<br>
   indexed access to containers of dstrings. All normal linked-list<br>
   operations are provided.<br>
</h3> 

<h2>DSTRINGARRAYS</h2>

<h3>
   dstringarrays are simple structures of an array of dstring pointers and a size element. <br>
   Additions and deletions are quick and consist of assigning <br>
   and deassigning pointers.<br>
   Generally you would not resize a dstringarray such as one would <br>
   with a linked list. Some utility functions are provided.<br>
</h3>

<h2>DSTRING UTILS</h2>
<h3>
   An example string manipulation utility is provided: dstring_utils.<br>
   It is both a string api and a program for working with strings. <br>
   It provides some string functions missing from stdlib that<br>
   are traditionally re-written by every programmer for every<br>
   program. (Why?) Most are part of other newer languages'<br>
   base apis by now anyway, like find, find &amp; replace, <br>
   remove a word from string, quote &amp; unquote, chomp ,slice,truncate, <br>
   trim, pad etc. I encourage creativity in <br>
   discovering new and useful functions to round out the <br>
   functionalities.<br>
</h3>
<h2>ALIASES &amp; MACROS</h2>


<h3>
   C is flexible. Extremely. So is my brain. Most of these <br>
   functions start with the noun dstring, then an underscore,<br>
   then a verb indicating the intent of the function. <br>
   Accordingly, 40% of the time I reverse them. <br>
   dstring_copy becomes copy_dstring,<br>
   new_dstring_init becomes dstring_new_init (oops! I just did it again!)<br>
   So the function names are aliases with #defines so the compiler<br>
   writes it correctly and I can go on. <br>
   The other aliases are MACROs to make programming with libdstring<br>
   easier and more intuitive. <br>
</h3>
 
<h2>DSSCANF</h2>

<h3>
  Parsing a dstring to extract variable data out of it into<br>
  ints and substrings and floats, etc. is possible with the<br>
  dsscanf utility. It takes the same format as libc sscanf<br>
  and indeed gcc and clang will parse the format string<br>
  for correctness at compile time just as if it were a sscanf <br>
  function. There is a catch, however. Just like sscanf, <br>
  dsscanf will seg fault if you send it an output parameter<br>
  with insufficient memory to hold the data you are trying<br>
  to stuff into it. Most of the time it will be another dstring<br>
  that is too small or unitialized or just a pointer with no<br>
  memory attached. Other problems would be bad values like reading<br>
  a negative integer into a size_t var or an 8-bit value into <br>
  a 16-bit numerical value not initializes to zero first, leaving<br>
  the upper 8 bits full of garbage.  <i>Sit Programmis Cauti.</i><br>
</h3>   

<h2>DSLOCAL</h2>

<h3>  
  DSLOCAL is a macro to generate localdstrings that are<br>
  automatically destroyed at the exit of their local <br>
  function scope. They are allocated on the stack by<br>
  the C runtime and so may be faster and more easy to use.<br>
  
  The DSLOCAL_FMT macro is functionally like the printf family: <br>
  it  creates a localdstring either from a static<br>
  string in quotes or with a printf format string and <br>
  variables. gcc and clang check the format string for<br>
  syntax just as if it were for printf. <br>
  There is a defined MAX size of 256 bytes to save memory for localdstrings, <br>
  but that is easily changed  by editing dstring.h <br>
  if for some reason you need more than that for a local string<br>
  inside a function.<br>
</h3>
<p>
  Example: <br>
</p>

<font size="3">
<pre class="prettyprint"> 
void f()
{ 
  /* myName and loc_ds are automatically de-allocated when f returns. */
  localdstring myName = DSLOCAL("Christopher");
  localdstring loc_ds = DSLOCAL_FMT( "RULE %d: %s never returns %s", 1 , myName, "localdstrings"); 
}

</pre>
</font>

<h2>BUGS</h2>

<h3>
   It's plain C, so the code is subject to bad input and especially<br>
   null pointer exceptions. I have tried to make it null pointer<br>
   proof as much as nominally possible, but using a pointer before<br>
   it has been initialized or after it has been freed still gums<br>
   up the works royally in any C program. <br>
   Be careful about assigning stray pointers at the beginning <br>
   and the end of the life or your dstrings, especially containers. <br>
   The size_t data is there to protect the programmer from mistakes <br>
   we all make, so use them. <br>
   Dropped pointers can leave massive memory leaks<br>
   until the program is over or cause crashes. The library has<br>
   been tested extensively for this, and internally it remains<br>
   orthogonal and integral as regards to memory and pointers<br>
   in almost all cases, even up to very large dstring lengths. <br>
<p>
   Localdstrings ,if used correctly, always get cleaned up <br>
   automatically. 
<p>Gcc and clang do some wily optimizations, <br>
  but should not destroy data before the last access <br>
  to a dstring in the code execution path.<br>
<p>
   Most crashes occur on two operations:<br>
   writing to a pointer that is uninitialized or points to <br>
   some random unexpected memory location, often off-limits to<br>
   the program; <br>
   or writing past the boundaries of an array.<br>
<p>
   An other time is when the contents of the string within<br>
   the dstring contain errors, and a libc function like <b>strlen</b> --<br>
   <i>(a little utility with a big temper)</i>, segfaults on its own.<br>
</h3>
<p>
<p>   
<h2>MODIFYING DSTRINGS</h2>

<h3>	  
   The dst struct is designed to be accessed by the string part<br>
   and then pointer arithmetic is used to get a pointer handle<br>
   to the structure itself. If the relationship memory-wise is<br>
   altered, all hell will break loose and the program will crash, hard.<br>
   A compromise is made between facility and memory security<br>
   by casting a pointer out of the char* internally to the <br>
   address of the beginning of the struct.<br>
<p>
   A hackish design  <i>(to facilitate code-reuse)</i> was implemented<br>
   to the dst struct by adding 8 bytes of filler to the struct <br>
   for 32-bit compilers. <br>
   This is wasted space, ( unless you find a use for it ) <br>
   but it allows the dst struct to be uniform in size<br>
   across 32-bit and 64-bit machines, despite the difference <br>
   in byte size of 4 bytes for 32-bit and 8 bytes for 64-bit <br>
   of the size_t  <i>(unsigned integer)</i>. <br> 
<font size="2" ><i>This should add no slow-down, <br>
    indeed it may make it faster on pentium-class 32-bit machines.</i></font>
<p>   
   DSTRING_MAX has been set to a 1GB limit<br>
   which is within both architecture's size_t limit.<br>
   A dstring will not usually need to be that big. <i>(I hope!)</i>.<br>

<h3>  
   gives the necessary information to the compiler and the<br>
   tiny runtime facilities of the malloc/realloc/free infrastructure<br>
   to properly address the struct without a prior reference to its <br>
   beginning in memory. This works because the char array is at<br>
   the tail end of the struct. <br>
   You then can access the struct's members by name: <br>
   (d-&gt;len , d-&gt;free , and d-&gt;str ).<br>
<p>
   Debuggers do not like this: it looks to their algorithms as<br>
   if you are exceeding the bounds of objects, and they give some<br>
   access errors if too many safeguards are turned on, but <br>
   actually you are not doing so. <br>
   The idea of addressing an object from an inside member <br>
   is novel, and not-at-all recommended unless it offers a large <br>
   benefit. <br>
</p><p>
   To examine a (struct dst) in a debugger such as gdb,
   address it like this: 
</p></figure></h3>
<font size="4" color="brown">
<samp>
<pre>      (gdb) p a
      $1= (dstring) 0x603020 "ABCDE"
      (gdb) p (struct dst*) (a-16) 
      $2 = (struct dst *) 0x603010
      (gdb) p <b>(struct dst</b>) (a-16)
      $3 = {len = 5, free = 27, str = 0x603020 "ABCDE"}
      (gdb) 
   
</pre>
</samp>
</font>

<h3>    
   In this case the benefit is that you can address<br>
   and use the structs as an ordinary c-style strings and<br>
   all the libc string ops work as usual.<br>
<br>
   The (ds - sizeof(*d)) idiom works for both 32 and 64 bit<br>
   architectures and should be scalable to other kinds of <br>
   structs such as binary-strings or wide_char strings or<br>
   (unsigned char), where the specific case of (ds - 16) <br>
   would not. It is also possible to add data members after the<br>
   char[] without penalty and access them from the struct,<br>
   but caution needs to be used because one could find <br>
   oneself in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.<br>
