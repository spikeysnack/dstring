/** local (stack allocated) dstrings 
 **
 **  Stack allocated objects are reclaimed when they go out of scope.
 **   This means you need not free them explicitly,
 **   and they take up no memory when the function exits.
 ** 
 **  It also means you can't send them into functions as 
 **   parameters, or return them from functions, or rely
 **   on their values externally to the current context.
 **
 **  In C this means the current function in the current file.
 ** 
 **  It is estimated ~80% of strings in a program are local
 **   to the function they are used in, so this make sense to 
 **   include them in dstrings as an option.
 ** 
 **  The structure is nearly identical to a regular dstring,
 **   except the d->str member is a fixed-length array of char
 **   instead of dstring's variable length array.
 **   This is more of a compiler requirement than a design decision;
 **   The compiler would not allow alloca to create a struct on the 
 **   stack of unknown size (probably a wise restriction).
 **
 **  The basic trick of accessing by the str pointer is used again
 **   and "Gee It Just Works" Â© so there you go. 
 ** 
 **  Just don't exceed LOCALMAX characters or the localdstring
 **   will be truncated to LOCALMAX. I set LOCALMAX to 256 because
 **   almost no sentence you might write is longer than that in a function,
 **   but you may set it to any multiple of 16 you deem appropriate for 
 **   your application.
 ** 
 **  The C macros in this file use a number of clever tricks designed to
 **   keep the allocation functions in the current scope and to avoid
 **   name collisions on repeated macro calls where variables are created.
 **   One technique is the __extension__ compiler directive which tells
 **   the compiler to turn off some pedantic warnings, coupled with an
 **   enclosing set of parentheses and curly brackets.
 ** 
 **  (__extension__ ({  ...code ... })) turns the enclosed code into
 **   an expression, and if you make sure the last code statement evaluates
 **   to a desired type that is what the expression "returns". 
 **  Another technique is to use a do{ ...code... }while(0) to create an
 **   enclosing scope within a macro. It also "returns" the last typed statement. 
 **  A third technique is to use multiple dependent macros to organize parameters and
 **   make macros friendlier or more in keeping with the api. Variadic macros
 **   use this a lot to simulate duck typing and roll  multiple functions into one.
 **
 **  It takes some mental gymnastics somtimes to understand why these work the
 **   way they do, and you can mess up using them in unexpected ways, but if you
 **   practice with them you will gain confidence and eventually the code will 
 **   flow from your fingers like a master mage's blessing of good fortune
 **   before the full moon festival night of drinking, feasting, and mating.
 **   ( Until then, type slowly and deliberately, checking yourwork, compiling 
 **     incrementally, getting each part right at each step. 
 **     The paradoxical mantra with C is, as always, "The hard way is the easy way.")
